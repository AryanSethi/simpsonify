# Simpsonify
This was an experiment in the field of Transfigurating cycle GANs to convert normal human faces into faces that look like simpsons without losing the base structure and features.
The experiment aims to test the quality of results for <i><b>Non image to image traslation</b></i> tasks like this one.
<br>
Because of the tremendous amount of compute power needed for this process, the results posted are only from 3 epochs of training (took more than 10 hours on my machine), yet some 
of the results were very interesting to look at. 
<i>You don't see simpsonified humans everyday :p </i>

For the dataset, 13k images of human faces as well as random Simpsons were used and a few results are shown below:

PS: Anyone with access to better machines can run the scripts on their ends and share the results with me. :)
